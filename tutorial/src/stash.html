Set the <span style="color: #ff0000;">version</span> to <span style="color: #ff0000;"><code>0.0.0</code></span>
in case you are first just playing around for a bit.
Semvar and npm is a bit lost on this "playing around" case,
since technically anyone could rely on your package the second you publish it to npm,
but it's still better than publishing it with <code>1.0.0 </code>following semvar, and being at version
<code>15.0.0</code> after two days of playing around. Alternatively you can not publish it to npm and use
<code>npm pack</code> locally. In any case, lets stick with the <code>0.0.0</code> here.
